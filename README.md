# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
The Bangalore House Prediction Model is an open-source machine learning project hosted on GitHub that aims to predict housing prices in Bangalore, India. This model is designed to assist potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions about property transactions.

The model is developed using various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, or gradient boosting, to leverage historical housing data. The dataset used for training comprises relevant features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and proximity to essential facilities like schools, hospitals, and public transportation.

     Model,                 Score,             RMSE
                    
Linear Regression:-       0.790384,          64.898435

Lasso:-                   0.803637,         62.813242

SVM:-                     0.206380,         126.278064

Random Forest:-           0.894814,          45.972773

XGBoost:-                 0.886607,          47.732530

# Random Forest has the Highest Accuracy , Lowest RMSE and Differnece btw cross validation score is also less(as compared to others ).

# Thank You
